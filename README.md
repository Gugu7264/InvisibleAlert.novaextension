# InvisibleAlert extension

This extension is capable of alerting you whenever a non-breaking space (NBSP) accidentally reached your code.
It will provide an issue to the Nova editor, and will appear as a warning in your file.
Never have accidental and unresolvable errors due to invisible non-breaking spaces anymore with InvisibleAlert!
